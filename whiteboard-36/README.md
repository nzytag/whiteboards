===

## Requirements
1. Write a function which takes two binary search trees as arguments, and compares them for structural likeness.
    - If they are structurally identical, return true
    - Else return false

Write at least four tests for this function
* your tests should cover basic (*expected*) functionality
* your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
