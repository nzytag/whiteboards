### Implement a Queue using only two Stacks

<!-- Notes for future reference: -->
<!-- Complexity
The push function is just a simple push on to the first stack which is O(1)O(1). The pop functionâ€™s worst case will still be O(n)O(n), but only when the second stack is empty. If the second stack contains items however then the algorithm is O(1)O(1). -->
